# Personal Research Assistant Agent
# 🔍 Project Overview

### The AI Research Summarizer Agent project aims to simplify the process of staying up-to-date with academic research by automating the task of searching and summarizing research papers. It assists researchers, students, and professionals by providing concise summaries of the latest papers from sources like arXiv, enabling more informed and faster literature reviews.

### The core idea is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and summarization models to transform dense academic abstracts into easily digestible summaries.

# 🧩 Problem Statement
### With the exponential growth in scientific publications, it becomes overwhelming to manually sift through and interpret numerous papers. Researchers struggle with information overload and time constraints. This project tackles the problem by automating:

### 1.Query-based search of latest research papers.

### 2.Extraction and summarization of research paper abstracts.

### 3.Delivery of readable summaries through a user-friendly interface.

# 📦 Data Source
### Used the arXiv API to fetch abstracts of recent academic papers based on user-input queries. arXiv is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for scholarly articles.



# 🧠 System Design & Functionality
### 1. Data Collection & Processing
#### Use arXiv API to retrieve papers based on search keywords.Extract and clean titles, authors, abstracts, and links.

### 2. Text Summarization
#### Load the facebook/bart-large-cnn summarization pipeline.Use it to generate short, human-readable summaries from raw abstracts.

### 3. Streamlit Web App
#### Users input a research topic.Backend fetches and summarizes relevant papers.Summaries and links are presented in a scrollable, styled UI.



# 📈 Results
### Successfully integrated arXiv paper search and BART summarizer.

### Users could input complex queries and receive understandable, brief summaries.

### Enabled researchers to rapidly scan academic literature.

# 🧾 Conclusion
### This project demonstrates how AI and NLP can be harnessed to accelerate research workflows. The summarizer agent reduces the cognitive load of reading abstracts, saving time and enhancing productivity. With future improvements (e.g., PDF summarization, voice summaries), the tool can become an even more valuable assistant.
